PrivacyBreacher is an Android app built as a proof of concept for a research article describing the privacy issues in Android. This app can access the following information from your phone *without requesting any permissions*:

 1. **Figure out at what time your phone screen turned on/off.**
 2. **Figure out at what time you plugged in or removed your phone charger and wired headphones.**
 3. **Figure out at what time you switched on/off your phone (i.e., it captures the device uptime and ACTION_SHUTDOWN broadcasts).**
 4. **Access most of your device related information like your phone model, manufacturer etc.**
 5. **Keep track of your WiFi/Mobile data usage.**
 6. **Get a list of all the apps installed on your phone.**
 7. **Construct a 3D visualization of your body movements.**

This app supports Android Pie (Android 9, API 28) or later versions. 

Edit: Some issues mentioned here might have been fixed in Android R, API 30 (the latest version of Android). Check out [this issue](https://github.com/databurn-in/Android-Privacy-Issues/issues/1) for more. We'll release an update for that soon. Currently, the privacy issues mentioned here are valid till Android Q (API 29).
